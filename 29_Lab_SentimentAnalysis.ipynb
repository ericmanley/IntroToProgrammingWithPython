    "This lab is a little different than the other labs we've done so far. The purpose of this lab is to get some experience dividing up a larger problem into several smaller ones that can each be isolated as a separate function. We'll also continue to add new functions with new program features in the next lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program you are going to write solves an important proble in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning - you will create a _sentiment analyzer_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is the problem of automatically detecting the general attitude behind a piece of written text. For example, does the text have a positive or negative attitude? Is it sarcastic? Is it a comment or a question? Is the mood happy, sad, angry, frustrated, etc.? A sentiment analyzer can help an organization sift through comments users have left on their website comment form, help flag Amazon product reviews that need a response from customer service, or help political campaigns get a feeling for what kinds of Tweets people are making on a candidate or issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our sentiment analyzer is going to automatically determine whether a movie review has a _positive_ or _negative_ sentiment. The effect is something like this:\n",

    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/user_interaction_movies.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sentiment analyzer will work by first determining the sentiment of each word in the review based on how it is used in sample movie reviews which have already been scored on range of 0 to 4 (with 0 being the most negative, 4 being the most positive, and 2 being neutral). The good news is that you already did this in the __CSV Files and Text Analysis__ lab using the Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a sentiment score for each word, the sentiment for an _entire review_ will simply be the average of the word sentiment scores. If the score for the whole review is 2 or greater, we'll call that a positive review; and if it is less than 2, it will be considered negative."

    "\n",
    "A word's sentiment score (the average number of stars for reviews containing that word) should be returned by the `word_score` function. To turn this into a function, we'll take out the `input` and `print` statements, and instead create a function which takes a word (a string) and the 2D list from the `movie_reviews.csv` file as an argument.
