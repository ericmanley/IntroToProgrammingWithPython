    "\n",
    "Encryption is the proceses of transforming a message into a new form that obscures its meaning. Encryption is important in many computer applications where sensitive information is involved - e.g., accessing your bank account over the Internet, databases that store customer Social Security Numbers, etc. A message that has not been encrypted is called _plaintext_ whereas a message that has been encrypted is called _ciphertext_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar cipher is an early encryption algorithm that was famously used by Julius Caesar. It works by substituting every letter with the letter that is three positions before it in the alphabet. For instance, the plaintext message\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"i came i saw i conquered\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "would be encrypted as\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"f zxjb f pxt f zlknrboba\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it wraps around the alphabet, so `\"c\"` becomes `\"z\"` and `\"a\"` becomes `\"x\"`. The full substitution table is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<tr> <td>plaintext character </td><td> a </td><td> b </td><td> c </td><td> d </td><td> e </td><td> f </td><td> g </td><td> h </td><td> i </td><td> j </td><td> k </td><td> l </td><td> m </td><td> n </td><td> o </td><td> p </td><td> q </td><td> r </td><td> s </td><td> t </td><td> u </td><td> v </td><td> w </td><td> x </td><td> y </td><td> z </td><td></td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td>ciphertext character </td><td> x </td><td> y </td><td> z </td><td> a </td><td> b </td><td> c </td><td> d </td><td> e </td><td> f </td><td> g </td><td> h </td><td> i </td><td> j </td><td> k </td><td> l </td><td> m </td><td> n </td><td> o </td><td> p </td><td> q </td><td> r </td><td> s </td><td> t </td><td> u </td><td> v </td><td> w </td><td></td></tr>\n",
    "    </table>\n",

    "To decrypt the message, you would reverse this process, and substitute each ciphertext character with the character that is three positions later in the alphabet.\n",

You can find a list of a whole bunch of characters and their equivalent codes here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters (see the Decimal column in these tables to find the number).
