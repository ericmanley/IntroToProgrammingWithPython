    "## Abstraction: Big idea in computer science\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** in computer science is the concept of hiding the details of how something works to make it easier to use for higher-level problem solving. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, designers of automobiles abstract away the details of how the engine works by hiding them beneath the hood of the car. They provide drivers with only the essential controls (e.g., steering wheel, gas pedal, etc.) needed to operate the car. This is great because it allows someone to learn to drive without having to understand automobile engine mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a chef doesn't need to know how to farm in order to cook food. The chef and farmer work at different levels of abstraction. The farmer creates a low-level detail - a basic building block that could be used in many different dishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already benefited from abstraction in software! You wrote several different print statements to display information to your user, and yet you didn't have to think about the details of how your data is processed and ultimately represented as different colors and patterns that appear on a computer display. Programming would be extremely difficult if we all had to solve all of the low-level problems in order to produce higher-level, more complex programs. This is ultimately what has allowed technology to develop and progress so quickly."
