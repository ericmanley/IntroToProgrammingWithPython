One way to crudely simulate what a person with one of these conditions would see is to average the red and green values for each pixel, but leave the blue value as it was originally.\n",

    "* (Medium) Classic filter: Look up the algorithm for a specific kind of color filter, and implement that (e.g., you can find a description of the Sepia algorithm here: https://dyclassroom.com/image-processing-project/how-to-convert-a-color-image-into-sepia-image )\n",
    "* (Medium) Red-eye remover: find any red pixel (say, where the red color value is greater than the sum of the blue and green color values), and change these pixels to black.\n",
