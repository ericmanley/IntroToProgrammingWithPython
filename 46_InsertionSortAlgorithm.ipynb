    "Because sorting is so common, it is a well-studied algorithmic problem with many different solutions. Famous sorting algorithms include [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort), [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort), [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort), [Heapsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort), [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort), [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), and [Bucket Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort). The built-in sorting algorithm that Python uses is called [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort), which combines ideas from Insertion Sort and Merge Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different sorting algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses, and their performance (in terms of computing time and memory needed) often depend on characteristics of the data being sorted. Usually, you want the one that is _fastest_ for your data/application/problem,\n",
